## Hi, I'm a GIS nerd and outdoor enthusiast. 

Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to have lived in some great West Coast states, from Alaska, Oregon, California, Colorado, and currently Washington. In my free time I spend a lot of time climbing (bouldering, trad, ice, alpine), trail running, and attending GIS events in Seattle.

I take pride in being a do-it-all GIS Specialist - though data collection, database design, data processing, and cartography. Feel free to contact me on social media or via email. I would be happy to grab coffee and discuss anything GIS.
