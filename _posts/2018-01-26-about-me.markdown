### Hi, I'm a GIS nerd and outdoor enthusiast. 

Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to have lived in many of the western states, from *Alaska, Oregon, California, Colorado, and Washington.* In my free time I spend a lot of time climbing (bouldering, trad, ice, alpine), trail running, and attending GIS events in Seattle.

I take pride in being a do-it-all GIS Specialist - through data collection, database design, data processing, and cartography; I can take a project from the start to the final product. Feel free to contact me on social media or via email. I would be happy to grab coffee and discuss anything GIS.
